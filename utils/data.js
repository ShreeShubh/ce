The training sessions were made very lively but never letting the reins go off his hands in demanding rapt attention from the trainees. The inputs were provided with the required stress and focus but never made them too repetitive or boring.  Another important thing I observed is that he made a mental note of fast learners and slow learners and accordingly trained so that the entire class could reach an optimal level with equivalent results. His sessions were fun and absolutely interactive which I consider very important in training.”",
